jupyter notebook tutorial for wave shaping

2 example codes to start playing with waveshaping of electrons 
propagate shows how e.g. a condensor aperture of certain phase and amplitude translates into a beam in a plane in the vicinity of the sample plane.
holographic shows the principle of holograhpic reconstruction by creating a specifically shaped binary aperture to recreate a desired wavefront

you can open these files in either visual studio code, jupter notebooks under anaconda, or directly online in binder.
