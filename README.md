# qem_tutorial
jupyter notebook tutorial for wave shaping

2 example codes to start playing with waveshaping of electrons 

## propagate 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/joverbee/qem_tutorial/blob/main/propagation.ipynb/HEAD)
Shows how e.g. a condensor aperture of certain phase and amplitude translates into a beam in a plane in the vicinity of the sample plane.

##holographic 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/joverbee/qem_tutorial/blob/main/holographic.ipynb/HEAD)
Shows the principle of holograhpic reconstruction by creating a specifically shaped binary aperture to recreate a desired wavefront
