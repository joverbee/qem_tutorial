# Zen and the art of electron wavefront shaping
Jupyter Notebook tutorial for electron wavefront shaping to acompany the lecture at QEM2022.
Contains 2 example codes to start playing with waveshaping of electrons. 


## propagation 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/joverbee/qem_tutorial/main?labpath=propagation.ipynb)
Shows how e.g. a condensor aperture of certain phase and amplitude translates into a beam in a plane in the vicinity of the sample plane.

## holographic 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/joverbee/qem_tutorial/main?labpath=holographic.ipynb)
Shows the principle of holograhpic reconstruction by creating a specifically shaped binary aperture to recreate a desired wavefront

## How to use
Easiest is if you click on the links in this readme which should bring you to a Binder space where you can run and change the code without installing anything on your local computer. You can change the code to your liking and your changes will not be permament and won't be visible to others.

For more intense work it is advised to either install Anaconda or Visual Studio and copy (or fork this repo) the ipynb files over to your local computer.

## Disclaimer
The code is provided without any waranties, use at your own risk and don't complain.
